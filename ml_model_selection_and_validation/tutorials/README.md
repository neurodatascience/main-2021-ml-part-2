# 12 - Machine learning part 2: dimensionality reduction

This directory contains the exercises we will use during the in-class tutorial for the Intro to Machine Learning part 2 module.

We will start with `fmri_site_prediction.py`, which is a continuation of the tutorial for module 11, "Intro to Machine Learning part 1: supervised learning".
Then, we will turn to `nested_cross_validation.py`.
Each of these files starts with instructions, and contains an incomplete python script that we will complete and run.
If you want to edit jupyter notebooks rather than python programs, you can use the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory -- they contain the same instructions and code.

The slides for the preparatory lecture are [here](https://github.com/neurodatascience/course-materials-2021/tree/master/lectures/30-July/12-intro-to-machine-learning-part-2/prerecorded-lecture-slides), and the recorded video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8D9qwTqEbc).
