# Model selection and validation

These are the materials for the second lecture on machine learning, which will
take place on Saturday, December 10.

The main focus is how to properly evaluate machine learning models and perform
hyperparameter selection, using tools from
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). We will also discuss
regularization and dimensionality reduction, so that we have examples of
hyperparameters to tune and more complex learning pipelines.

To run the exercises we need python 3.7 or newer and the packages listed in
`exercises/requirements.txt` -- if you followed the [setup
instructions](https://main-educational.github.io/installation.html) on
the MAIN educational website you have all this already.

The slides for the lecture are in `lecture-content/model_selection_and_validation.pdf`,
and during the lecture we will regularly pause to edit and execute scripts found
in `exercises/`.

This lecture will be taught by [Jérôme Dockès](https://jeromedockes.github.io/)
and [Nikhil Bhagwat](https://nikhil153.github.io/).
